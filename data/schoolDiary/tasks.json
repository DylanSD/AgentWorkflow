Users are prompted to perform various actions on the dates, such as:\n\n1. **Marking events**: Adding specific dates or periods (e.g., birthdays, holidays, appointments) with corresponding labels or colors.\n2. **Scheduling tasks**: Assigning due dates or reminders for tasks, projects, or deadlines.\n3. **Tracking progress**: Monitoring completed tasks or milestones within a set timeframe.\n\nThe goal of this task is to demonstrate an understanding of the calendar layout and functionality, as well as the ability to make logical connections between dates and events.",
